Desktop Color Picker

Color them is playing a key role inside any application, it helps user to recognize rather remember certain information like Errors, Notifications and Information. A recent project that I had to work on (A Dashboard), had a number of different colors specified from the design. And also each and every client meeting ended up with list of new color suggestion for example “Can you pick a color similar to this one/that one/darker version of this …..”. Picking a color from a image is easy if you have tools like Photoshop, but In my Dev machine I don’t have one, Even if I had it takes bit of extra memory JUST TO PICK A COLOR CODE.

Some time ago I visited a page from MSDN Forum which is about developing a screen pixel color reader similar to this one How do I test the color of a certain pixel or point.

With the help of it I have developed following Color Picker Application which will capture a screen pixel and copies the color code to Clipboard.
